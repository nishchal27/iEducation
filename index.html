            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.[2]


                Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3] The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European
                civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.[4]

                In China, Confucius (551â€“479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's most influential ancient
                philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like
                Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt
                his ideals for good governance, but his Analects were written down by followers and have continued to
                influence education in East Asia into the modern era.[5]</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Lets learn together</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit
                purpose is teaching students. Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with
                classrooms of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most
                school systems are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that
                system. Such choices include curriculum, organizational models, design of the physical learning spaces
                (e.g. classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational
                activities, and more.[15][16]

                The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) was created by UNESCO as a statistical
                base to compare education systems.[17] In 1997, it defined 7 levels of education and 25 fields, though
                the fields were later separated out to form a different project. The current version ISCED 2011 has 9
                rather than 7 levels, created by dividing the tertiary pre-doctorate level into three levels. It also
                extended the lowest level (ISCED 0) to cover a new sub-category of early childhood educational
                development programmes, which target children below the age of 3 years.[18]</p>
